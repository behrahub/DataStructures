//stay in any of the free rooms, or any of the rooms befelow any of the free rooms.

//Given matric a rectangular matrix of integers, where each value represents the cost of the room, you task is to return the total sum
//of all rooms that are suitable for the codebots (ir: add up all the values that con't appear below a 0;)
