/*
An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer
network that uses the internet protocol fro communication. There are two versions of the internet protocol
and thus two versions of addresses. One of them is the IP4 address;

Given a string, find out if it satisfies the IPv4 address naming rules.

For inputString = "172.16.256.1" the output should be
isIPV4Address(inputString) =  true;


For inputString = "172.316.254.1" the output should be
isIPV4Address(inputString) =  false;


For inputString = ".254.256.0" the output should be
isIPV4Address(inputString) =  false;
